// Give a text file, print the words with their frequency. Now print the kth word in term of frequency.
// Hint:
// a) First approach may be you can use the sorting and return kth element.
// b) Second approach: You can use the kth element quick select algorithm
// c) Third approach: You can use Hashtable or Trie to keep track of the frequency. Use Heap to get the Kth element.
