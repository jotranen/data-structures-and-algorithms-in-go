// Given a list of 0s and 1s. We need to sort it so that all the 0s are before adll the 1s.
//	Hint: Use two variable, start and end. Start set to 0 and end set to (n1). Increment start and decrement end.
//	Swap the values stored at arr[start] and arr[end] only when arr[start] == 1 and arr[end] == 0.
//Stop when start is equal to end or styart is greater than end.
